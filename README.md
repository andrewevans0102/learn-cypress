# learn-cypress

This is a sample app shows how to use [Cypress.io](https://www.cypress.io/) for testing. It is is used with [the blog post here]().

The app is very simple, but has sample pages for:

- forms (login)
- lists
- network requests

The `network requests` page makes calls to [the Star Wars API](https://swapi.co/).
