# learn-cypress

This is a sample app shows how to use [Cypress.io](https://www.cypress.io/) for testing. It is is used with [How to get started with Cypress](https://www.newline.co/@AndrewEvans/how-to-get-started-with-cypress--0bed3a8b).

The app is very simple, but has sample pages for:

- forms (login)
- lists
- network requests

The `network requests` page makes calls to [the Star Wars API](https://swapi.dev/).

This project also uses [ng bootstrap](https://github.com/ng-bootstrap/ng-bootstrap#installation).

As of 03/15/2021 I have updated it to the latest version of Angular. If you have issues with installation or getting this to run [please check out the docs](https://cli.angular.io/).
